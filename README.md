# 🎓 Master’s Thesis – Multi-Agent System in Unity using ML-Agents

This repository contains the development overview of my Master’s thesis:

**“Implementation and Analysis of a Multi-Agent System through Game Development in Unity using ML-Agents”**  
Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb (2024)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this thesis was to design, implement, and analyze a **multi-agent reinforcement learning system** within a 3D game environment built in Unity.

The project combines:

- 🎮 Game development (Unity, C#)
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- 🧠 Reinforcement Learning
- 👥 Multi-Agent Systems

A 3D zombie-based game environment was created, where intelligent agents learn how to navigate, interact, and pursue objectives using reinforcement learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Research Focus

The thesis explores:

- Theoretical foundations of Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning
- Multi-Agent Systems architecture
- Agent-environment interaction modeling
- Reward-based learning and optimization

Agents were trained to:

- Navigate complex environments
- Avoid obstacles
- Interact with game elements
- Optimize behavior through reward signals

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:

### 1️⃣ Unity Environment (Simulator)
- 3D game world
- Agent bodies (zombie characters)
- Physics, animations, UI, sound system
- Observation collection
- Reward assignment

### 2️⃣ Python Training Environment (ML-Agents)
- Policy training
- Neural network optimization
- Data processing
- Reinforcement learning pipeline

Unity acts as a **data generator and simulator**, while Python handles **model training and decision-making**.

## 🎮 Game Environment

The game environment includes:

- Player-controlled character
- Multiple zombie agents
- Training zones
- Reward-based interactions
- Obstacle navigation
- Event-driven animation system
- Audio and visual feedback

Agents operate in a shared environment, forming a **decentralized multi-agent system** without global control.

## 🔬 Multi-Agent Learning Approach

The learning process follows Reinforcement Learning principles:

1. Observation
2. Decision
3. Action
4. Reward / Penalty
5. Policy Update

Key characteristics:

- Decentralized decision-making
- Parallel asynchronous agent behavior
- Reward shaping for task optimization
- Simulation-based training cycles
